## How to Read This Report

### Status Indicators
- ‚úÖ **PASSED**: All quality checks passed, code is ready for review
- ‚ùå **NEEDS ATTENTION**: Some checks failed, issues must be addressed

### Priority Levels
- üî¥ **Critical**: Must fix before merge (build failures, type errors, failing tests)
- üü° **High Priority**: Should address soon (formatting, low coverage, security)
- üü¢ **Medium Priority**: Consider for improvement (complexity, documentation)
- ‚ö™ **Low Priority**: Nice to have (style, minor optimizations)

### Coverage Thresholds
- **Statements**: Target >80%
- **Branches**: Target >75%
- **Functions**: Target >80%
- **Lines**: Target >80%

### What to Do Next

#### If Status is ‚úÖ PASSED:
1. Review any medium or low-priority suggestions
2. Proceed with pull request
3. Consider improvements for next iteration

#### If Status is ‚ùå NEEDS ATTENTION:
1. Address all critical issues first
2. Fix high-priority items
3. Re-run assessment: `npm run self-assess`
4. Repeat until all checks pass
