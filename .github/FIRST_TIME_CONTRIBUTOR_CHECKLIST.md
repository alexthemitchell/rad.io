## Common Issues and Solutions

### Tests Failing

**Problem**: Tests pass locally but fail in CI

- **Solution**: Run full test suite with `npm test` (not watch mode)
- **Solution**: Check if you're using consistent Node.js version

### Linting Errors

**Problem**: Linting fails

- **Solution**: Run `npm run lint:fix` to auto-fix most issues
- **Solution**: Check ESLint output for specific issues

### Merge Conflicts

**Problem**: PR has conflicts with main

- **Solution**: Merge latest main into your branch
- **Solution**: Ask for help in PR comments if stuck

### Build Failing

**Problem**: Webpack build fails

- **Solution**: Delete `node_modules` and `dist`, run `npm install` again
- **Solution**: Check Node.js version (need 18+)
