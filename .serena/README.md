# Self-Assessment Memory

This directory stores self-assessment reports and findings generated by the self-assessment agent.

## Purpose

The memory system maintains a historical record of code quality assessments, allowing you to:

- Track quality improvements over time
- Review past suggestions and their outcomes
- Identify recurring issues
- Monitor test coverage trends
- Document important findings

## Structure

```
.serena/memories/
├── README.md                    # This file
├── index.md                     # Chronological index of all reports
└── assessment-YYYY-MM-DD.md     # Individual assessment reports
```

## Report Contents

Each assessment report includes:

### 1. Summary
- Overall status (pass/fail)
- Quick reference table of all checks
- Timestamp and quality score

### 2. Test Coverage Metrics
- Statement coverage percentage
- Branch coverage percentage
- Function coverage percentage
- Line coverage percentage

### 3. Detailed Findings
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript results
- **Build Status**: Webpack build results
- **Test Results**: Jest test execution results

### 4. Categorized Suggestions
- **Critical**: Must fix before merge
- **High Priority**: Should address soon
- **Medium Priority**: Consider improving
- **Low Priority**: Nice-to-have improvements

### 5. Next Steps
- Immediate action items
- Long-term improvement recommendations

## Usage

### View Latest Assessment

```bash
# Check the index
cat .serena/memories/index.md

# View most recent report
cat .serena/memories/assessment-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md
```

### Generate New Assessment

```bash
# Run the self-assessment agent
node .github/agents/self-assessment.js
```

### Search Past Reports

```bash
# Find all assessments with failures
grep -l "❌ NEEDS ATTENTION" .serena/memories/assessment-*.md

# Find assessments with high test coverage
grep -l "Statements.*9[0-9]%" .serena/memories/assessment-*.md
```

## Retention Policy

- **Assessment Reports**: Kept for 30 days
- **Important Findings**: Can be manually preserved by moving to a permanent location
- **Index**: Maintained indefinitely

## Best Practices

1. **Review Regularly**: Check reports after major changes
2. **Track Trends**: Compare coverage and quality over time
3. **Address Issues**: Don't ignore recurring suggestions
4. **Clean Up**: Periodically remove old reports per retention policy

## Index Format

The `index.md` file maintains a chronological list:

```markdown
# Self-Assessment Reports

Index of quality assessment reports.

## Reports

- [2024-10-15T19:00:00.000Z] ✅ [Assessment Report](assessment-2024-10-15.md)
- [2024-10-14T15:30:00.000Z] ❌ [Assessment Report](assessment-2024-10-14.md)
```

## Integration

Reports are automatically:
- Generated by the self-assessment agent
- Indexed in `index.md`
- Named with timestamp for easy chronological sorting
- Formatted in markdown for easy reading

## Privacy & Security

⚠️ **Important**: These reports may contain:
- Code snippets
- Error messages
- File paths
- Project structure information

**Do not commit sensitive information** in these reports. The directory is included in `.gitignore` by default.

## Troubleshooting

### Reports Not Being Generated

**Check**:
1. `.serena/memories/` directory exists
2. Self-assessment script has write permissions
3. No disk space issues

**Solution**:
```bash
mkdir -p .serena/memories
chmod -R u+w .serena/memories
```

### Index Not Updating

**Symptom**: New reports not appearing in index

**Solution**:
```bash
# Manually rebuild index
ls -1t .serena/memories/assessment-*.md | while read f; do
  echo "- [$(date -r "$f" -Iseconds)] [Assessment Report]($(basename "$f"))"
done > .serena/memories/index.md.new
mv .serena/memories/index.md.new .serena/memories/index.md
```
