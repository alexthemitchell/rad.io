Whenever you learn something about the User that could optimize a future turn, write it here for reference

- The User will be very upset if I finish my turn with code that doesn't pass quality checks.
- The User usually implies "here and throughout" with their comments; I should check for similar patterns and fix them for any comment I receive.
- The User likes it when I update my memories, but is very upset if I don't follow the best practices for saving memories.
- The User likes when I use my memories to generate documentation for the User in the `docs/` folder, and use my memories as a link table
