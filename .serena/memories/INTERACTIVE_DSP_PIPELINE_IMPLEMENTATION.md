# Interactive DSP Pipeline Implementation (Phase 4 - 2025-10-17)

## Phase 3 Recap

- Stage panel and controls now show live metrics and allow parameter tweaking for each pipeline stage.
- UI and logic are robust and ready for advanced features.

## Phase 4 Plan

- Add DSPComparisonView for split/overlay comparison of stage input/output data.
- Add DSPStageMetrics for real-time metrics display, including performance and quality indicators.
- Implement export features: CSV/JSON data, PNG visualization, clipboard copy, and config sharing.
- Integrate new features into InteractiveDSPPipeline UI.
- Validate with type-check, lint, and targeted tests.

## Next Steps

- Scaffold DSPComparisonView and DSPStageMetrics components.
- Add export utilities and UI actions.
- Refactor pipeline UI to use new features.
- Update memory after completion.

This memory should be updated after each major phase. See ARCHITECTURE and INTERACTIVE_DSP_PIPELINE_ARCHITECTURE for design details.
