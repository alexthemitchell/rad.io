Visualizer now buffers live IQ samples in src/pages/Visualizer.tsx and feeds SampleChart, WaveformChart, FFTChart, and SignalStrengthMeterChart via props; canvases in IQConstellation, WaveformVisualizer, and Spectrogram set CSS width/height before rendering. Tests pass for VisualizationSDRData. Current blockers: WebUSB controlTransferOut failures from HackRFOne streaming and WASM FFT fallback aborts, so UI falls back to demo samples. Next steps: debug HackRF control sequence/endpoint usage and stabilize WASM pipeline to restore live visualizations.
