Purpose: Map older or overlapping memories to consolidated replacements to minimize noise. Do not delete originals; use this as the canonical pointer.

Deprecation map
- suggested_commands → REPO_WORKFLOW_QUICKSTART (more complete daily loop + pitfalls)
- SERENA_MEMORY_CONSOLIDATED_BEST_PRACTICES → Keep, but start at MEMORY_INDEX for faster navigation
- project_overview → Keep; for actionable steps use REPO_WORKFLOW_QUICKSTART and CI_QUALITY_GATES_SUMMARY
- DEBUGGING_METHODOLOGY → Keep; for WebUSB/device-specific issues prefer WEBUSB_SDR_INTEGRATION_PLAYBOOK and WEBUSB_STREAMING_DEBUG_GUIDE
- HACKRF_DEVICE_INITIALIZATION_BUG_FIX → Keep; referenced by WEBUSB_SDR_INTEGRATION_PLAYBOOK. Start at MEMORY_INDEX

How to use
- Start at MEMORY_INDEX to choose the right high-signal memory.
- If you land on a deprecated or overlapping memory, follow the arrow above to the replacement.
- Update this mapping whenever you add a new consolidated memory.
