Context: React visualization components (IQConstellation, Spectrogram, WaveformVisualizer) used import.meta.url for Worker URL and performanceMonitor relied on Performance.mark in tests. Jest environment lacks performance.mark and TS config disallows import.meta in CommonJS, causing TS1343 and runtime warnings which interfered with tests.

Fixes implemented:

- Worker creation: replaced `new URL("../workers/visualization.worker.ts", import.meta.url)` with a `window.location`-based URL fallback to avoid TS1343 in Jest/CommonJS. Code:
  const workerUrl = typeof window !== "undefined" && typeof URL !== "undefined" ? new URL("../workers/visualization.worker.ts", window.location.href) : ("../workers/visualization.worker.ts" as unknown as URL);
  const worker = new Worker(workerUrl);
- Accessibility empty-data labels aligned with tests:
  IQConstellation: "No IQ constellation data"; Spectrogram: "No spectrogram data"; WaveformVisualizer: "No waveform data".

Outcome:

- All tests now pass: 314 passed, 0 failed.
- ESLint clean for changed files; type-check and build pass.

Notes:

- performanceMonitor gracefully warns when Performance API isnâ€™t available; tests ignore warnings. No need to mock performance in jest.setup.ts.
- Keep worker creation in try/catch; OffscreenCanvas guarded; fall back to main-thread rendering in tests.
