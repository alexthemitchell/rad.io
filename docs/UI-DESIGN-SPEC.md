## 1. Target users and success criteria

Primary personas

- Ham Radio Enthusiast (Experimenter): quick tune, decode PSK/RTTY/SSTV, record, bookmarks
- Radio Monitoring Professional (Analyst): calibrated spectrum, markers, logging, export
- Academic Researcher (Scientist): datasets (SigMF), teaching visuals, reproducibility
- Emergency Communications (Responder): reliability, simplicity, fast access to known channels
- Broadcast Engineer (Professional): measurement suite, mask checks, reporting

Success criteria

- High‑density yet legible UI; core tasks achieved with <3 actions
- Real‑time interactions never block visuals; tuning latency <16 ms feedback
- Keyboard‑first operation; full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Consistent, inspectable outputs: exportable images, CSV/JSON logs, SigMF metadata

---

## 2. Information architecture (IA)

Global shell

- Top app bar: brand (rad.io), Connect/Device menu, Record, Bookmarks, Settings, Help
- Main work area: Dockable panes (Spectrum, Waterfall, Constellation, Eye, Tools)
- Left sidebar (collapsible): Devices, Bookmarks, Scanner, Recordings
- Right sidebar (collapsible): Radio controls (Frequency, Mode, Filters, AGC, Squelch, Audio)
- Bottom status bar: sample rate, buffer health, GPU mode (WebGPU/WebGL/2D), FPS, storage, audio state (playing/muted/suspended, clipping)

Primary routes

- Live Monitor (default): Spectrum + Waterfall stacked, right controls, bottom status
- Scanner: Scan configuration + activity log + mini‑spectrum
- Analysis: Constellation, Eye, advanced measurements, marker table
- Recordings: Library, playback, export, quota management

View/pane model

- Panes can be stacked or split; layout persists. Default Live layout:
  - Left: Bookmarks (collapsed on small widths)
  - Center: Spectrum (top), Waterfall (bottom)
  - Right: Controls

---

## 3. Visual language and theming

Design intent

- “Modern laboratory instrument” aesthetic (PRD): dark UI, high contrast, minimal chrome
- Color is functional; avoid decorative gradients in analysis areas

Color system (OKLCH; see tokens)

- Backgrounds: Void Black, Deep Slate, Gunmetal
- Foreground: Silver, Muted Gray
- Accent: Cyan (tuning), Electric Blue (primary action)
- Status: Green (good), Amber (warning), Red (error)
- Visualization palettes: Viridis (default), Plasma/Inferno/Magma options; grayscale option

Typography

- Inter (UI), JetBrains Mono (numeric/measurements). Tabular figures for all numeric readouts.
  - Implementation: numeric readouts use tabular figures and slashed‑zero for clarity.
  - Utility class: `.rad-tabular-nums` enables this where needed.

Density and spacing

- Default compact density; 12/16/24 px spacers; 8 px for icon toolbars

Elevation

- Subtle shadows for interactive cards/panels; avoid heavy blur; emphasize content not chrome

Theming and system integration

- Token‑driven themes via CSS Custom Properties (see `src/styles/tokens.css`).
- Default dark theme; opt‑in light theme via `.theme-light` or `[data-theme="light"]`.
- System coherence with `color-scheme: dark light` set on `:root`.
- Global `accent-color` sourced from `--rad-accent` for supported form controls.

Touch targets ≥44×44 px on mobile; drag/zoom adapted to touch gestures; haptics optional.

---

## 10. Design tokens (brief)

Tokens are defined in `src/styles/tokens.css` (OKLCH) and drive both light and dark themes. Key groups:

- Color: background/foreground, primary, accent, success/warn/error, border, ring
- Typography: font stacks; type scale variables (0.75/0.875/1/1.25/1.5 rem); line‑height presets
- Spacing: 2/4/8/12/16/24/32/48 px scale
- Radius: 2/4/6/8/12 px; border width
- Elevation: shadow levels (1/2/3)
- Z‑index: overlay (1000), modal (1100), toast (1200)
- Motion: transition speeds (fast/medium/slow) and standard easing curve
- Focus: ring color, width, offset

Adoption plan: incremental—map existing CSS to variables, enable dark theme via root class without breaking tests.

Implementation status (2025‑10‑27)

- `tokens.css` is present and in use with OKLCH tokens for color, typography, spacing, motion, and focus.
- `:root` declares `color-scheme: dark light` for native control coherence.
- Global `accent-color` is now sourced from `--rad-accent` to theme supported form controls consistently.

## 11. Error, empty, and offline states

- Device unavailable (non‑Chromium): Show guidance, simulate mode toggle, link to docs
- USB disconnect: Non‑blocking toast + reconnect attempts; preserve state; prominent status badge
- GPU fallback: Toast + status bar indicator ("Rendering with Canvas 2D fallback")
- Storage near quota: Banner with cleanup wizard link
- Empty panes: concise explainer + primary action; never blank screens

---

## 12. QA and verification

- A11y: jest‑axe suite must stay green; add tests for new components; enforce 25+ jsx‑a11y rules
- Performance: add opt‑in FPS monitor in dev; add benchmarks for 60 FPS target (8192 bins)
- Cross‑browser: Chrome/Edge primary; Safari/Firefox with graceful USB fallbacks
- E2E: Playwright flows for Connect → Tune → Record → Export, and Scanner workflows

---

## 13. Implementation plan (incremental, low risk)

Phase A – Foundations

- Introduce tokens.css; create StatusBar; add GPU tier/fps/buffer health; no visual breakage
  - Status: Implemented (tokens present; StatusBar integrated in app shell with GPU tier/FPS/buffer/ storage; aria-live announced)
- Add FrequencyDisplay and VFOControl components (not yet wired)
  - Status: Implemented as components; wiring continues via `FrequencyContext`
- Write keyboard shortcuts help (? overlay)
  - Status: Implemented (`ShortcutsOverlay` toggled with `?`)

Phase B – Layout and panes

- Add resizable split panes for Spectrum/Waterfall; persist layout
- Migrate existing Spectrogram/Waterfall views into panes; maintain current tests

Phase C – Measurement tools

- Add MarkerTable; implement deltas and CSV export
- Add RBW, peak hold, and grid toggles to Spectrum toolbar

Phase D – Scanner and logging

- Scanner UI per roadmap; activity log with waterfall thumbnails

Phase E – Calibration and settings

- Add calibration wizard UI (PPM and gain offset); storage management details

All phases: preserve accessibility guarantees, maintain green tests, run lint/type checks, keep diffs focused.

---

## 14. Visual references (conceptual)

- Layout: Top bar, left bookmarks, center stacked Spectrum/Waterfall, right controls, bottom status bar
- Styling: Dark panels on deep canvas; cyan accents for focus/tuning; Viridis as data palette

This spec should guide implementation without forcing risky rewrites. It aligns with PRD goals, leverages ADRs, and fits the current codebase structure.
