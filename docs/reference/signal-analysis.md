# Signal Analysis Techniques

## Overview

Signal analysis is the process of examining radio signals to identify type, content, and characteristics. This guide covers practical techniques for SDR users.

## Visual Signal Identification

### Waterfall Patterns

The waterfall display is your primary tool for signal identification.

#### Continuous Carriers

**Appearance**: Vertical line, constant color
**Examples**: Beacons, carriers, local oscillators
**Analysis**: Check for drift, modulation

#### AM Broadcasting

**Appearance**: Thick vertical bar with symmetrical sidebands
**Bandwidth**: ~10 kHz
**Features**: Carrier visible even with no audio

#### SSB Voice

**Appearance**: Asymmetric "smear" on one side of frequency
**Bandwidth**: ~2.7 kHz
**Features**: No carrier spike, one-sided
**USB**: Energy above center frequency
**LSB**: Energy below center frequency

#### FM Voice (NFM)

**Appearance**: Wide vertical streak when transmitting, disappears when silent
**Bandwidth**: ~12.5-16 kHz
**Features**: Captures quieter signals (capture effect)

#### FM Broadcast (WFM)

**Appearance**: Very wide signal, ~200 kHz
**Features**: May see stereo pilot tone at 19 kHz offset

#### CW (Morse Code)

**Appearance**: Very narrow vertical line, turning on/off in patterns
**Bandwidth**: <500 Hz
**Features**: Extremely narrow, periodic keying

#### RTTY

**Appearance**: Two parallel vertical lines
**Spacing**: Typically 170 Hz, 425 Hz, or 850 Hz
**Features**: Marks and spaces, constant when transmitting

#### PSK31

**Appearance**: Single narrow carrier, constant amplitude
**Bandwidth**: ~60 Hz
**Features**: Very narrow, looks like weak carrier
**Pattern**: Phase changes not visible in waterfall

#### FT8

**Appearance**: Short bursts (15 seconds), multiple tones
**Timing**: Synchronized to 15-second intervals (:00, :15, :30, :45)
**Bandwidth**: ~50 Hz per signal
**Features**: Multiple stations visible simultaneously

#### SSTV

**Appearance**: Diagonal lines sweeping across frequency range
**Pattern**: Repeating scan lines
**Bandwidth**: ~3 kHz
**Duration**: 30-120 seconds per image

#### Digital Voice (DMR, D-STAR)

**Appearance**: Steady signal when transmitting, blocky pattern
**Features**: Digital artifacts, no traditional audio

## Spectrum Analysis

### Reading the Spectrum Display

**Noise Floor**: Baseline level across spectrum

- Flat = good
- Sloped = filter response or AGC issues
- Spiky = interference

**Peak Detection**: Find signals above noise floor

- Height = signal strength
- Width = bandwidth
- Shape = filter characteristics

**Dynamic Range**: Difference between strongest and weakest visible signals

### Measuring Signal Parameters

#### Center Frequency

1. Zoom in on signal
2. Find peak in spectrum
3. Read frequency at peak
4. For SSB: carrier is outside visible spectrum

#### Bandwidth

1. Note frequencies at -3 dB points (half power)
2. Calculate difference
3. Compare to expected values

#### Signal Strength

- **Absolute**: Read dBFS or dBm value
- **Relative**: Compare to noise floor (SNR)
- **S-units**: S9 = -73 dBm (HF) or -93 dBm (VHF)

## Demodulation Testing

### Choosing the Right Mode

| If you hear...                 | Try mode...                 |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Clear voice, local station     | FM (NFM)                    |
| Voice with background noise    | AM                          |
| Distorted/unintelligible voice | SSB (USB or LSB)            |
| Musical tones                  | Data mode (decode needed)   |
| Rhythmic beeps                 | CW (Morse code)             |
| Nothing but carrier visible    | Wrong mode or no modulation |

### Mode-Specific Tuning

#### AM

- Center on carrier spike
- Adjust bandwidth to 8-10 kHz
- Enable AGC

#### SSB

- Tune until voice sounds natural (not Donald Duck or deep)
- USB: tune slightly low, bring up
- LSB: tune slightly high, bring down
- Critical: within Â±50 Hz for intelligibility

#### FM

- Center on signal
- Squelch eliminates noise between transmissions
- Should be clear or silent (no static)

#### CW

- Adjust BFO for comfortable tone (400-800 Hz)
- Very narrow filter (100-500 Hz)
- Practice reading Morse code

## Signal Quality Assessment

### Audio Quality Indicators

**Excellent**:

- Clear, no noise
- Full frequency response
- No distortion

**Good**:

- Minor background noise
- Mostly clear
- Occasional fading

**Fair**:

- Significant noise
- Readable but requires attention
- Frequent fading

**Poor**:

- Barely readable
- High noise
- Severe fading or distortion

### Digital Mode Success

**FT8/Digital Modes**:

- Check SNR values in software
- -10 dB or better = good
- -20 dB or better = excellent
- Below -24 dB = may fail to decode

**SSTV**:

- Clean diagonal lines
- No noise bands
- Sync pulses clear

### Interference Identification

#### Continuous Interference

**Pattern**: Always present, same location
**Sources**:

- Local electronics (computers, power supplies)
- Power lines (harmonics of 50/60 Hz)
- LED lights

**Solutions**:

- Turn off local devices
- Use filters
- Change antenna location

#### Intermittent Interference

**Pattern**: Comes and goes
**Sources**:

- Household appliances
- Motors
- Light dimmers

**Solutions**:

- Identify timing pattern
- Locate source
- Add filtering at source

#### Co-channel Interference

**Pattern**: Two signals on same frequency
**Result**: Heterodyne tone, distortion
**Solutions**:

- Choose stronger signal (FM capture effect)
- Narrow filter (SSB/CW)
- Change frequency

## Propagation Analysis

### Band Conditions

#### Indicators of Good Propagation

### Time of Day Effects

**HF Bands**:

- **20m**: Good day and night, best for DX
- **15m/10m**: Daytime only (solar activity dependent)

**VHF/UHF**: Generally line-of-sight

- **Tropo**: Extended range during weather inversions
- **Sporadic E**: Sudden long-distance propagation on 6m/2m

### Using Beacons
