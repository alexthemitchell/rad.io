## Review Findings

### Overall Assessment

All 15 existing ADRs have been reviewed against MADR v4 format and PRD philosophy alignment. While the ADRs contain good technical content and reasoning, most do not follow the MADR v4 structure completely.

### MADR v4 Required Sections

Per the official template, each ADR should contain:

1. **Title** - Short noun phrase
2. **Context and Problem Statement** - What is the problem we're trying to solve?
3. **Decision Drivers** - Forces/factors influencing the decision
4. **Considered Options** - List of alternatives explored
5. **Decision Outcome** - Chosen option with justification
6. **Consequences** - Results of the decision (Good/Bad/Neutral)
7. **Confirmation** - How to validate the decision
8. **Pros and Cons of the Options** - Detailed analysis of each option
9. **More Information** (optional) - Links, implementation details, references

## PRD Alignment Analysis

All ADRs align well with PRD philosophical goals:

### ✅ Precision

- Type safety (ADR-0007) ensures correctness
- Validation at boundaries prevents errors
- Deterministic DSP algorithms
- Hardware-accurate calibration

### ✅ Powerful

- Web Workers enable parallel processing (ADR-0002)
- GPU acceleration for visualization (ADR-0003, 0015)
- Multi-device support architecture
- Real-time processing pipelines

### ✅ Professional

- Research-grade measurement capabilities
- Comprehensive testing strategy (ADR-0006)
- Error handling and resilience (ADR-0011)
- Offline-first for reliability (ADR-0010)

## Format Issues Identified

### Missing from Most ADRs

1. **"Context and Problem Statement"** section
   - Most ADRs have "Context" but missing explicit "Problem Statement"
   - Should clearly state the problem being solved

2. **"Decision Drivers"** section
   - Forces influencing the decision not explicitly listed
   - Should include technical, business, and PRD-driven factors

3. **"Considered Options"** as standalone section
   - Options scattered or in "Alternatives Considered" at end
   - Should be listed upfront before decision

4. **"Confirmation"** subsection
   - Missing validation/measurement criteria
   - How do we know the decision was correct?

5. **"Pros and Cons of the Options"** detailed section
   - Most ADRs only document chosen option's consequences
   - Should analyze ALL options considered

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **ADRs 0001 and 0010** - ✅ Already updated to MADR v4 format
2. **Remaining 13 ADRs** - Reformat to MADR v4 structure

### Reformatting Template

For each ADR, restructure as follows:

```markdown

- [etc.]

## Considered Options

- [Option 1]
- [Option 2]
- [Option 3]

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "[Option X]", because [justification. e.g., only option
that satisfies all decision drivers, best trade-off between X and Y].

### Consequences

- Good, because [positive consequence 1]
- Good, because [positive consequence 2]
- Bad, because [negative consequence 1]
- Bad, because [negative consequence 2]
- Neutral, because [neutral consequence]

### Confirmation

[How will we know if this decision was correct? Metrics, validation, etc.]

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### [Option 1]

- Good, because [argument a]
- Good, because [argument b]
- Bad, because [argument c]
- Neutral, because [argument d]

### [Option 2]

- Good, because [argument a]
- Bad, because [argument b]
- ... etc.

## More Information

[Optional: Links, implementation details, migration notes, etc.]
