# Use MADR v4 for Architecture Decision Records

## Context and Problem Statement

WebSDR Pro is a complex, professional-grade signal analysis application requiring sophisticated architectural decisions across DSP, real-time visualization, hardware integration, and browser APIs. The application must be precise, powerful, and professionalâ€”qualities that demand well-documented, justified technical choices. How do we capture architectural decisions in a way that preserves context, rationale, and trade-offs for current and future development?

## Decision Drivers

- Need to document "why" behind technical choices, not just "what"
- Multiple complex subsystems (DSP, WebGL, WebUSB, Web Workers, WebAudio) require clear decision boundaries
- Professional-grade application demands engineering rigor and traceability
- Team knowledge transfer and onboarding efficiency
- Regulatory/compliance scenarios may require decision audit trails
- Precision and determinism values require documented reasoning
- Complex application status (per PRD) necessitates structured decision-making

## Considered Options

- **Option 1**: MADR v4 (Markdown Architecture Decision Records)
- **Option 2**: ADR without specific template (freeform)
- **Option 3**: Confluence/Wiki pages
- **Option 4**: Code comments only
- **Option 5**: No formal decision documentation

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **"MADR v4"** because it provides a lightweight, version-controllable, structured format that integrates with code review processes while maintaining professional rigor. MADR v4's explicit sections for options, consequences, and links align with the precision and professionalism required for laboratory-grade instrumentation software.

### Consequences

- Good, because decisions are version-controlled alongside code
- Good, because structured format ensures completeness (context, options, consequences)
- Good, because Markdown integrates with existing development workflows
- Good, because ADRs become searchable, referenceable documentation
- Bad, because requires discipline to maintain and update ADRs
- Bad, because adds overhead to decision-making process (acceptable trade-off for complex application)

### Confirmation

Each ADR will be reviewed during pull requests. Superseded decisions will be marked but retained for historical context. ADR quality will be assessed based on completeness of sections and clarity of reasoning.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Option 1: MADR v4

- Good, because provides clear, consistent structure
- Good, because Markdown is familiar and integrates with Git workflows
- Good, because searchable and linkable within codebase
- Good, because template ensures key information isn't omitted
- Neutral, because requires learning MADR structure
- Bad, because adds process overhead

### Option 2: Freeform ADR

- Good, because flexible and faster to write
- Bad, because inconsistent structure hinders readability
- Bad, because easy to omit critical information (options considered, trade-offs)

### Option 3: Confluence/Wiki

- Good, because rich formatting and collaboration features
- Bad, because external to codebase (versioning issues)
- Bad, because can become stale and disconnected from code reality

### Option 4: Code Comments Only

- Good, because co-located with implementation
- Bad, because architectural decisions span multiple files
- Bad, because inadequate for cross-cutting concerns
- Bad, because not searchable at decision level

### Option 5: No Formal Documentation

- Good, because zero overhead
- Bad, because knowledge loss over time
- Bad, because repeated debates on settled issues
- Bad, because incompatible with professional/precise quality attributes from PRD

## More Information

### ADR Location and Naming

ADRs stored in `/docs/decisions/` with format: `NNNN-title-with-dashes.md`

### ADR Lifecycle

1. **Proposed**: ADR drafted, under review
2. **Accepted**: ADR approved and in effect
3. **Deprecated**: Decision no longer recommended (but still in use)
4. **Superseded**: Replaced by newer ADR (link to successor)

### Scope for ADRs

**Create ADRs for:**

- DSP algorithm choices (FFT libraries, worker architecture)
- Rendering strategies (WebGL vs Canvas, shader designs)
- Storage mechanisms (IndexedDB schemas, persistence strategies)
- API selections (Web Audio, WebUSB, WebGPU)
- State management patterns
- Testing strategies
- Security and validation approaches

**Do NOT create ADRs for:**

- UI component styling (covered by PRD design system)
- Routine bug fixes
- Minor refactorings without architectural impact
