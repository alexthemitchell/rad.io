# Pipeline Optimization Strategy (2025)

**Status**: Implemented  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Stakeholders**: Development Team, CI/CD Operations

## Context

The rad.io build, test, and deploy pipeline has potential for optimization across multiple dimensions:

- Build performance (WASM + JavaScript bundling)
- Test execution speed and reliability
- CI/CD caching and parallelization
- Deployment efficiency and validation
- Code quality integration

Current metrics:

- Build time: ~11.4s (WASM: 2.8s, Webpack: 8.6s)
- Test time: ~60s (116 suites, 1612 tests, 7 skipped)
- Bundle size: 625 KB (exceeds 615 KB recommended)
- Coverage: 38-96% with strict enforcement
- E2E: Playwright with mock/simulated/real hardware modes

## Decision

Implement a multi-phase optimization strategy targeting CI/CD efficiency, build performance, and test reliability.

### Phase 1: CI/CD Optimization

**1.1 Enhanced Caching Strategy**

- Separate cache keys for WASM, node_modules, and dist
- Cache invalidation based on content hashes
- Parallel cache restoration for faster job startup
- Playwright browser caching (already implemented, verify optimal)

**1.2 Job Parallelization**

- Continue parallel lint/test/format/type-check (already optimal)
- Ensure WASM build cache is available to dependent jobs
- Reduce cache restoration overhead

**1.3 Artifact Management**

- Implement artifact retention cleanup (already in place)
- Add artifact size monitoring
- Compress artifacts before upload

### Phase 2: Build Performance

**2.1 Webpack Optimization**

- Add webpack-bundle-analyzer for insights
- Implement tree shaking verification
- Optimize chunk splitting strategy
- Add build performance metrics

**2.2 WASM Build**

- Current optimization is good (3s build, 12KB output)
- Monitor for regression
- Consider incremental builds if needed

**2.3 Bundle Size Management**

- Add bundle size tracking to CI
- Implement size budget enforcement
- Alert on unexpected size increases

### Phase 3: Test Optimization

**3.1 Test Execution**

- Currently using 50% maxWorkers - optimal for CI
- Add test result caching for unchanged files
- Implement test distribution strategies
- Add performance tracking

**3.2 Coverage Enforcement**

- Current strategy is excellent (strict per-module thresholds)
- Add coverage delta reporting
- Implement Codecov patch gates (80% patch coverage)

**3.3 E2E Testing**

- Playwright caching is implemented
- Add E2E test result artifacts
- Implement smoke tests for deployment validation

### Phase 4: Deployment

**4.1 Build Validation**

- Current validation is good (file existence, size checks)
- Add lighthouse performance checks
- Implement automated smoke tests

**4.2 Deployment Speed**

- Use build cache to skip unnecessary rebuilds
- Add deployment performance metrics
- Implement blue-green deployment strategy

**4.3 Post-Deployment Validation**

- Current HTTP 200 check is basic
- Add content validation
- Implement automated E2E smoke tests

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Immediate)

1. Webpack bundle analyzer integration
2. Bundle size tracking and enforcement
3. Build performance metrics
4. Enhanced test parallelization

### Medium Priority (Next Sprint)

1. Test result caching
2. Lighthouse CI integration
3. Enhanced deployment validation
4. Performance budgets

### Low Priority (Future)

1. Incremental WASM builds
2. Blue-green deployment
3. Advanced test distribution
4. Multi-region CDN optimization

## Consequences

### Positive

- Faster CI/CD feedback loops (target: <5min for PR checks)
- Better build performance visibility
- Proactive bundle size management
- More reliable deployment validation
- Reduced CI costs through better caching

### Negative

- Additional complexity in CI configuration
- More tooling to maintain
- Potential cache invalidation issues
- Learning curve for new tools

### Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk**: Cache poisoning leads to incorrect builds
  - **Mitigation**: Hash-based cache keys, regular cache cleanup
- **Risk**: Bundle analyzer adds build time
  - **Mitigation**: Only run on specific triggers (PR, main branch)
- **Risk**: Strict budgets block legitimate features
  - **Mitigation**: Clear process for budget adjustments

## Metrics for Success

**Before Optimization:**

- PR CI time: ~8-10 minutes
- Build time: 11.4s
- Test time: 60s
- Bundle size: 625 KB
- Cache hit rate: ~70%

**Target After Optimization:**

- PR CI time: <5 minutes
- Build time: <10s
- Test time: <45s
- Bundle size: <620 KB (with monitoring)
- Cache hit rate: >85%

**Monitoring Points:**

- CI job duration trends
- Cache hit/miss rates
- Bundle size over time
- Test execution time per suite
- Deployment success rate
- Post-deployment validation metrics
