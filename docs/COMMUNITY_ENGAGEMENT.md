# Community Engagement & Metrics

This document outlines how we track and improve community engagement in rad.io.

## Engagement Goals

### Primary Objectives

1. **Increase Active Contributors**: Grow monthly active contributors
2. **Improve Response Times**: Faster feedback on issues and PRs
3. **Enhance Onboarding**: Reduce time-to-first-contribution

### Success Metrics

We track these metrics quarterly:

#### Contributor Metrics

- Number of unique contributors per quarter

- Contributor retention rate (return after first PR)

#### Response Metrics

- Average time-to-first-review on PRs
- Issue resolution time
- PR merge time

#### Quality Metrics

- Test coverage (maintain global minimum of 38% for statements/lines; see [docs/ONBOARDING.md](./ONBOARDING.md#coverage-requirements))
- Code review thoroughness
- Documentation completeness

## Automated Tracking

### GitHub Actions Workflows

We've implemented several automation workflows to improve community engagement:

**1. Welcome Bot (`.github/workflows/welcome.yml`)**
- Greets first-time issue authors with helpful resources
- Welcomes first-time PR contributors with onboarding checklist
- Provides links to documentation and community channels

**2. Auto-labeling (`.github/workflows/label-issues.yml`)**
- Automatically categorizes issues based on content
- Labels: documentation, testing, hardware, performance, accessibility, visualization, etc.
- Identifies good first issues for newcomers
- Helps contributors find relevant issues faster

**3. Stale Management (`.github/workflows/stale.yml`)**
- Identifies inactive issues (60 days) and PRs (30 days)
- Sends gentle reminders before closing
- Respects exempt labels (pinned, security, in-progress, blocked)
- Removes stale label when updated

**4. Contributor Recognition (`.github/workflows/contributor-recognition.yml`)**
- Celebrates milestone PRs (1st, 5th, 10th, 25th, etc.)
- Thanks all contributors after merge
- Encourages continued participation
- Builds community culture

**5. Community Metrics (`.github/workflows/community-metrics.yml`)**
- Generates monthly health reports automatically
- Tracks contributors, issues, PRs, response times
- Saves reports to `.github/metrics/`
- Provides data for continuous improvement

### GitHub Insights
