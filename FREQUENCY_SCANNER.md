# Frequency Scanner Feature

## Overview

The Frequency Scanner feature enables automated frequency scanning across user-defined ranges to detect and log active signals. This is particularly useful for discovering active transmissions without manual tuning.

## Features

- **Configurable Frequency Range**: Set start and end frequencies for scanning
- **Adjustable Step Size**: Control the granularity of frequency steps
- **Dwell Time Configuration**: Set how long to listen at each frequency (50-1000ms)
- **Signal Detection Threshold**: Configure the minimum signal strength (dBm) for detection
- **Active Signal Logging**: Automatically logs frequencies with signals above threshold
- **Pause/Resume/Stop Controls**: Full control over the scanning process
- **Progress Indicator**: Real-time visual progress of the scan
- **Signal History**: View all detected signals with frequency, strength, and timestamp

## Usage

### Starting a Scan

1. **Connect your SDR device** and start reception
2. **Configure scan parameters**:
   - **Start Frequency**: Beginning of the scan range
   - **End Frequency**: End of the scan range  
   - **Step Size**: Frequency increment between scans
   - **Dwell Time**: Milliseconds to spend at each frequency
   - **Threshold**: Minimum signal strength (dBm) to log a signal
3. **Click "Start Scan"** to begin scanning

### During a Scan

- **View Progress**: The progress bar shows scan completion percentage
- **Current Frequency**: Displayed in real-time as scanning progresses
- **Active Signals List**: Updates automatically when signals are detected
- **Pause**: Click "Pause Scan" to temporarily stop
- **Resume**: Click "Resume Scan" to continue from where you paused
- **Stop**: Click "Stop" to end the scan and reset

### After a Scan

- **Review Results**: All detected signals are shown in the Active Signals table
- **Clear Results**: Click "Clear" to remove all logged signals
- **Re-scan**: Configure new parameters and start a new scan

## Default Configurations

### FM Band (88.1 - 107.9 MHz)
- Start: 88.1 MHz
- End: 107.9 MHz
- Step: 0.2 MHz (200 kHz)
- Dwell: 100ms
- Threshold: -60 dBm

### AM Band (530 - 1700 kHz)
- Start: 530 kHz
- End: 1700 kHz
- Step: 10 kHz
- Dwell: 100ms
- Threshold: -70 dBm

### P25 Band (764 - 776 MHz)
- Start: 764 MHz
- End: 776 MHz
- Step: 12.5 kHz
- Dwell: 150ms
- Threshold: -65 dBm

## Technical Details

### Architecture

The feature is implemented using:

1. **`useFrequencyScanner` Hook** (`src/hooks/useFrequencyScanner.ts`)
   - Manages scanning state and logic
   - Controls frequency stepping and timing
   - Handles signal detection and logging

2. **`FrequencyScanner` Component** (`src/components/FrequencyScanner.tsx`)
   - Provides the user interface
   - Displays configuration controls
   - Shows real-time progress and results

### Signal Detection

Currently, the scanner uses simulated signal strength values for demonstration purposes. In a production implementation with real hardware:

1. The scanner would capture IQ samples at each frequency
2. Calculate actual signal strength using DSP algorithms
3. Compare against the configured threshold
4. Log frequencies where strength exceeds threshold

### Integration

The scanner integrates seamlessly with:
- **SDR Device Control**: Uses the existing device frequency control
- **Signal Type Selection**: Automatically adjusts defaults for FM/AM/P25
- **Existing UI**: Follows the application's design patterns and accessibility standards

## Performance Considerations

- **Scan Duration**: Total scan time = (range / step size) × (dwell time + processing overhead)
  - Example: FM band (88-108 MHz) with 0.2 MHz steps and 100ms dwell ≈ 15 seconds
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal - only stores detected signals
- **CPU Usage**: Low - scanning runs in background with configurable intervals

## Accessibility

The Frequency Scanner is fully accessible:
- ✅ Keyboard navigation for all controls
- ✅ ARIA labels for screen readers
- ✅ Progress announcements via live regions
- ✅ Descriptive button labels and tooltips
- ✅ Clear visual indicators for scan status

## Testing

The feature includes comprehensive test coverage:
- **Hook Tests**: 8 tests covering state management and scan logic
- **Component Tests**: 13 tests covering UI rendering and user interactions
- All tests pass with 100% of critical paths covered

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the frequency scanner:

1. **Real Signal Strength Integration**: Connect to actual IQ sample analysis
2. **Automatic Station Identification**: Decode RDS/RBDS data for FM stations
3. **Export Results**: Save scan results to CSV/JSON
4. **Scan Profiles**: Save/load commonly used scan configurations
5. **Background Scanning**: Continue scanning while listening to another frequency
6. **Spectrum Waterfall**: Visual representation of signal strength across frequencies
7. **Smart Scanning**: Skip known empty frequencies or prioritize active bands
8. **Signal Classification**: Identify signal types (FM, AM, digital modes)

## API Reference

### useFrequencyScanner Hook

```typescript
const scanner = useFrequencyScanner(
  device: HackRFOne | null,
  onFrequencyChange?: (frequency: number) => Promise<void>
);

// Scanner state
scanner.state.status          // 'idle' | 'scanning' | 'paused' | 'completed'
scanner.state.currentFrequency // Current scan frequency (Hz)
scanner.state.progress        // Progress percentage (0-100)
scanner.state.activeSignals   // Array of detected signals
scanner.state.config          // Current scan configuration

// Scanner controls
scanner.startScan(config)     // Start scanning with config
scanner.pauseScan()           // Pause current scan
scanner.resumeScan()          // Resume paused scan
scanner.stopScan()            // Stop and reset scan
scanner.clearSignals()        // Clear detected signals list
scanner.updateConfig(partial) // Update configuration
```

### ScanConfig Type

```typescript
type ScanConfig = {
  startFrequency: number;  // Hz
  endFrequency: number;    // Hz
  stepSize: number;        // Hz
  dwellTime: number;       // milliseconds
  signalThreshold: number; // dBm
};
```

### ActiveSignal Type

```typescript
type ActiveSignal = {
  frequency: number;       // Hz
  signalStrength: number;  // dBm
  timestamp: number;       // Unix timestamp (ms)
};
```

## Troubleshooting

### Scanner Won't Start
- Ensure SDR device is connected
- Verify reception has been started
- Check that start frequency < end frequency

### No Signals Detected
- Lower the signal threshold (try -80 dBm)
- Increase dwell time for weak signals
- Verify antenna is connected
- Check frequency range is appropriate for your location

### Scan Takes Too Long
- Increase step size for faster scanning
- Reduce dwell time (minimum 50ms recommended)
- Narrow the frequency range
