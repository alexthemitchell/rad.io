# End-to-End Speech Synthesis & Recognition Testing

## Overview

This document describes the automated end-to-end test suite for validating the rad.io speech processing pipeline using the Web Speech API. The tests encode audio with the Web Speech Synthesis API and decode it with the Speech Recognition engine to validate system accuracy and robustness.

## Architecture

### Test Pipeline

```
Text Input → Speech Synthesis → Audio Stream → Speech Recognition → Text Output → Validation
```

The complete E2E pipeline simulates real-world radio broadcast scenarios:

1. **Text Encoding**: Text phrases are converted to audio using Web Speech Synthesis API
2. **Audio Stream Processing**: Synthesized audio is processed through the audio stream pipeline
3. **Speech Recognition**: Audio is decoded back to text using Web Speech Recognition API
4. **Accuracy Validation**: Transcription accuracy is measured and validated

### Key Components

#### Mock Speech Synthesis API

The test suite includes a complete mock implementation of the Web Speech Synthesis API:

- **MockSpeechSynthesisUtterance**: Simulates text-to-speech utterances with configurable voice, rate, pitch, and volume
- **MockSpeechSynthesis**: Manages speech synthesis with asynchronous speaking simulation
- **MockSpeechSynthesisVoice**: Provides multiple voice options (English, Spanish, French)

#### Mock Speech Recognition API

Enhanced mock implementation for speech recognition:

- **MockSpeechRecognition**: Simulates the Web Speech Recognition API with perfect transcription of synthesized text
- **Static Expected Transcript**: Allows setting expected transcripts across test instances
- **Confidence Scoring**: Returns realistic confidence scores (0.95) for successful recognition

#### Test Utilities

- **`synthesizeSpeech()`**: Converts text to audio using Speech Synthesis API
- **`performE2ETest()`**: Executes complete synthesis-to-recognition pipeline
- **`calculateAccuracy()`**: Measures word-level transcription accuracy
- **`createMockAudioStreamResult()`**: Generates audio stream data for testing

## Test Scenarios

## Running the Tests

### Execute E2E Test Suite

```bash
# Run only E2E tests
npm test -- speechSynthesisE2E.test.ts

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage speechSynthesisE2E.test.ts

# Run in watch mode for development
npm run test:watch -- speechSynthesisE2E.test.ts
```

### Run All Tests

```bash
# Run complete test suite (171+ tests)
npm test
```

## Implementation Details

### Web API Usage

All tests use **only Web APIs** with no external dependencies:

- **Web Speech Synthesis API**: Text-to-speech encoding
- **Web Speech Recognition API**: Speech-to-text decoding
- **Web Audio API**: Audio stream processing
- **AudioContext**: Audio buffer management

### Browser Compatibility

The test suite uses mocked Web APIs for test environment compatibility:

- **Production**: Chrome/Edge (full support), Safari (partial support)
- **Test Environment**: Jest with JSDOM (fully mocked APIs)
- **Mock Quality**: High-fidelity mocks simulating real API behavior

### Test Configuration

Key test configurations:

- **Default Timeout**: 5000ms
- **Long Test Timeout**: 10000-15000ms (for sequential multi-test scenarios)
- **Recognition Config**: Non-continuous mode, no interim results for deterministic testing
- **Synthesis Config**: Standard rate (1.0), pitch (1.0), volume (1.0)

## Integration with CI/CD

The E2E test suite integrates with the existing quality control pipeline:

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The tests run as part of the standard test suite in `.github/workflows/quality-checks.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Run Tests
  run: npm test
```

This ensures:
- All PRs validate E2E functionality
- No regressions in speech processing pipeline
- Comprehensive coverage reporting

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Noise Injection Testing**: Add simulated radio noise/interference
2. **Multi-Channel Audio**: Test stereo and multi-channel scenarios
3. **Streaming Recognition**: Test continuous/streaming mode more extensively
4. **Performance Benchmarks**: Add timing and performance metrics
5. **Real Audio Samples**: Integrate with actual radio broadcast recordings
6. **Additional Languages**: Expand language support testing
7. **Voice Quality Metrics**: Add audio quality assessment

### Production Integration

For production use with real radio broadcasts:

1. **Server-Side Recognition**: Consider cloud speech recognition services for recorded audio
2. **WebSocket Streaming**: Implement real-time streaming recognition
3. **Web Workers**: Offload DSP processing to background threads
4. **Microphone Loopback**: Test with actual audio playback and capture

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Test Timeouts**

If tests timeout, increase the timeout value:
```typescript
it("test name", async () => {
  // test code
}, 15000); // 15 second timeout
```

**Mock Initialization Errors**

Ensure global mocks are properly setup in `beforeAll()`:
```typescript
beforeAll(() => {
  global.AudioContext = MockAudioContext as unknown as typeof AudioContext;
  (global as any).speechSynthesis = mockSpeechSynthesis;
  // ...
});
```

**Accuracy Calculation Issues**

The accuracy calculation is word-level:
- Splits on whitespace
- Case-insensitive comparison
- Returns value from 0.0 to 1.0
