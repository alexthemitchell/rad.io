### Frequency Scanner

The automated frequency scanner sweeps through a user-defined range to detect and log active signals.

**Configuration:**

1. **Start Frequency**: Lower bound of scan range (MHz)
2. **End Frequency**: Upper bound of scan range (MHz)
3. **Step Size**: Frequency increment between scans (kHz)
4. **Detection Threshold**: Signal strength required to log a signal (0-100%)
5. **Dwell Time**: Time spent on each frequency (ms)

**Usage:**

1. Configure scan parameters (default: 88-108 MHz, 100 kHz steps, 30% threshold)

3. Active signals are detected and logged in the table
4. Use "Pause" to temporarily halt scanning
5. Use "Resume" to continue from paused state
6. Use "Stop" to end scanning completely
7. Export results to JSON for further analysis

**Active Signals Table:**

- Lists all detected signals sorted by strength
- Shows frequency, signal strength percentage, and detection time
- Color-coded strength bars: Red (weak), Orange (moderate), Green (strong)
- "Export" button saves results as JSON file
- "Clear" button removes all detected signals from the list

**Note**: Device must be connected and scanning only works for FM/AM modes (not P25).

- PowerShell is the default shell; commands shown use npm scripts so they work the same across platforms.
- The `clean` script uses `rimraf` for cross‚Äëplatform deletion of `dist`, `node_modules`, and `build`.

## Agent guide: Serena memories

For AI agents contributing to this repository, use Serena memories to keep context lean and high-signal:

- Start by listing available memories and look for "SERENA_MEMORY_BEST_PRACTICES".
- Read that memory for concise best practices on minimizing noise-to-signal in context, retrieval order, and when/what to write.
- Only write new memories for durable, reusable knowledge (architecture decisions, debugging playbooks, repo-wide workflows). Prefer updating an existing memory over creating duplicates.
- Favor symbol-first exploration over full-file reads. Avoid re-reading the same content with multiple tools.

See `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for detailed agent workflows and available tools.
