## Usage Guide

### Connecting Your SDR Device

1. **Connect Hardware**: Plug in your SDR device via USB
2. **Click "Connect Device"**: Browser will show device selection dialog
3. **Select Your Device**: Choose your SDR from the list
4. **Grant Permission**: Allow the web app to access the device

### Tuning to a Station

**Method 1: Preset Stations**

1. Select signal type (FM/AM)
2. Click a preset station button
3. Device automatically tunes to the frequency

**Method 2: Manual Entry**

1. Enter frequency in the input field
2. Units automatically adjust (MHz for FM, kHz for AM)
3. Press Enter or click away to apply

### Starting Reception

1. Ensure device is connected
2. Click "Start Reception" button
3. Visualizations update with live data
4. Click "Stop Reception" to pause

### Frequency Scanner

The automated frequency scanner sweeps through a user-defined range to detect and log active signals.

**Configuration:**

1. **Start Frequency**: Lower bound of scan range (MHz)
2. **End Frequency**: Upper bound of scan range (MHz)
3. **Step Size**: Frequency increment between scans (kHz)
4. **Detection Threshold**: Signal strength required to log a signal (0-100%)
5. **Dwell Time**: Time spent on each frequency (ms)

**Usage:**

1. Configure scan parameters (default: 88-108 MHz, 100 kHz steps, 30% threshold)
2. Click "Start Scan" to begin automated scanning
3. Active signals are detected and logged in the table
4. Use "Pause" to temporarily halt scanning
5. Use "Resume" to continue from paused state
6. Use "Stop" to end scanning completely
7. Export results to JSON for further analysis

**Active Signals Table:**

- Lists all detected signals sorted by strength
- Shows frequency, signal strength percentage, and detection time
- Color-coded strength bars: Red (weak), Orange (moderate), Green (strong)
- "Export" button saves results as JSON file
- "Clear" button removes all detected signals from the list

**Note**: Device must be connected and scanning only works for FM/AM modes (not P25).

### Understanding the Visualizations

**IQ Constellation Diagram**

- Shows I (in-phase) and Q (quadrature) signal components
- Density-based coloring: blue (sparse) ‚Üí cyan ‚Üí white (dense)
- Circular pattern = FM signal
- Varying magnitude = AM modulation
- Distinct points = Digital modulation

**Amplitude Waveform**

- Time-domain signal envelope
- Red line = Maximum amplitude
- Orange line = Average amplitude
- Green line = Minimum amplitude
- Useful for: AM detection, signal strength monitoring

**Spectrogram (Power Spectral Density)**

- Frequency spectrum over time
- Color scale: Purple (low power) ‚Üí Yellow (high power)
- Horizontal axis = Time
- Vertical axis = Frequency
- Bright bands = Strong signals

### Interactive Visualization Controls

All visualizations support advanced pointer and wheel events for intuitive exploration:

**Mouse & Pointer:**

- **Pan**: Click and drag to move the view
- **Zoom**: Use mouse wheel to zoom in/out
- **Reset**: Click "Reset View" button when transformed

**Touch & Multi-Touch:**

- **Pan**: Single finger drag
- **Pinch-to-Zoom**: Two finger pinch gesture
- **Tap**: Focus on specific signal features

**Keyboard Navigation** (for accessibility):

- **Arrow Keys**: Pan in any direction (‚Üê, ‚Üí, ‚Üë, ‚Üì)
- **+/-**: Zoom in and out
- **0**: Reset to default view

Interactive controls are implemented via `src/hooks/useVisualizationInteraction.ts` and used across visualization components such as `Spectrogram`, `IQConstellation`, and `WaveformVisualizer`.

## Windows notes

- PowerShell is the default shell; commands shown use npm scripts so they work the same across platforms.
- The `clean` script uses `rimraf` for cross‚Äëplatform deletion of `dist`, `node_modules`, and `build`.

## Agent guide: Serena memories

For AI agents contributing to this repository, use Serena memories to keep context lean and high-signal:

- Start by listing available memories and look for "SERENA_MEMORY_BEST_PRACTICES".
- Read that memory for concise best practices on minimizing noise-to-signal in context, retrieval order, and when/what to write.
- Only write new memories for durable, reusable knowledge (architecture decisions, debugging playbooks, repo-wide workflows). Prefer updating an existing memory over creating duplicates.
- Favor symbol-first exploration over full-file reads. Avoid re-reading the same content with multiple tools.

See `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for detailed agent workflows and available tools.
